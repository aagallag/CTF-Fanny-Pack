I'll convert a first person statement to a second person statement. I even wrote it in C++ to be super-safe about my strings!

The application asks you to say something about yourself.  It then replaces any ocurances of the letter 'I' with the word 'you'.  Using this, you can cause a buffer overflow on the string.  The goal is to override the return memory address with the address corresponding with the function get_flag(), which will execute "cat flag.txt".

Payload structure:
	'A' + 'I'*21 + GET_FLAG_MEMORY_ADDR

We add the 'A' in front to offset the padding, which ensures that the address for get_flag() ends up in the correct position.

Flag: sctf{srcpy_was_a_mistake}
