This book appears to have a gold six-fingered hand glued to the front, with the
number "2" written on it. The book looks strangely familiar, but you can't seem
to place it. You feel that it is out of place. You flip through the pages, and
note some interesting text towards the end:

b33n_m1$sing_t3h_

There is also a section on cryptography. You memorize it, just in case.
You have gained the cryptography skill!

Wait, no it's not. You flip through the pages, and see some odd text. It seems
to be encoded with some strange scheme...
Fortunately, the knowledge of cryptography you gained from reading the strange
book with the gold hand lets you decode it. It says:

The tree looks metallic and dusty. You see what looks to be a door in the tree.
Inside the tree is what appears to be a control box. You flip some switches,
but nothing happens. Upon closer examination of the control box, you see strange
writing. Good thing you know cryptography. It says:
